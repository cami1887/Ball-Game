# Ball Game

## About
This app was made by following a vanilla Javascript tutorial linked [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Create_the_Canvas_and_draw_on_it) . It is a ball game made to reinforce my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. More features were added to this game beyond the basic tutorial. I decided to only use a couple breakpoints as this game is made to be played on a computer's full screen.
