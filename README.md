# Ball Game
## Description
This is a small and basic ball game made to reinforce my hmtl, css, and js skills I made by following a beginner vanilla Javascript tutorial linked [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Create_the_Canvas_and_draw_on_it). More features were added to this game beyond the basic tutorial.

## Project Status
While development has slowed down, I will eventually add more features as my knowledge expands.
