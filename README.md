<h1>Ball Game<h1>

*This ball game was created by following a beginner javascript tutorial. Will be adding features to improve it.*

In this game, you play as a bunny saving the world from alien attacks. Send out a projectile of your choice into the UFOS to eliminate them. In order to move to the next stage, you must clear all of the UFOS. You lose if you fail to bounce back the projectile 3 times. However, you can always start again.

Over time I have added background music, sound effects, a description, different projectile options, multiple levels, and the ability to turn off any sound. While there are some slight bugs (There is a slight delay in the collision audio as well as the tendency for it to 'blend' together in a way that leaves the game feeling unfinished. There are also limited levels and the UFOS are stuck in a row and column orientation that I have interest in eventually changing. The gameplay itself is slightly choppy as you can see the page 'flicker' at multiple points when playing. Your character also tends to bounce back the projectile even when nothing touches it (although this issue is hardly noticeable)), the game is in a state that is playable and decently appealing. As I learn more, I will attempt to add a scoreboard that stores your score from prior games. I may also add the ability to pause the game.

Possibly will add a rotation to the projectile animation and movement in the ufos. Ufos may shoot projectiles and "special" ufos may fly across the screen as an opportunity for bonus points.
